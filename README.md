# Texas State brand demos

During the 2015 Texas State University digital brand overhaul, I made a bunch of little demos testing elements like typography, color, images, and layouts. This repo is essentially a list of these things.

There's also a [case study about the process on my website](https://michaeledelstone.com/portfolio/texas-state-brand).
